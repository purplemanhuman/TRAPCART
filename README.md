# TRAPCART
A fun little project I have worked on for my Database Management System. Uses very basic HTML, PHP and CSS along with a MySQL database.

A basic project for anyone looking for self learning PHP and making an ECommerce site on their own.

You are welcome to make changes and customize this project according to your own preference and help me make this basic project better.

PS - I do not know why I named the website "TRAPCART". It's not a trap, I just thought it was cool.

Thank you and happy coding.
